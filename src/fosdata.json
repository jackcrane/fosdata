What’s challenging is quantifying this dysfunction, putting numbers to a trend that is — at least anecdotally — a pretty clear reality.\"",

      "details": "From the authors: \"Although the scientific community increasingly recognizes that its communication with the public may shape civic engagement with science, few studies have characterized how this communication occurs online. This study sets out to explore how users engage with science communication items on different platforms of social media, and what are the characteristics of the items that tend to attract large numbers of user interactions.\"",

Children are told to say \"day\" when shown a picture of the moon and stars, and to say \"night\" when shown a picture of the sun. Time to complete test and number correct (0 incorrect, 1 point for self-corrected, 2 points for correct) are measured. Counting-span test. Children were required to count the number of red dots on cards, and recall the number of dots without looking at them. Given in sets of 1 through 5. Max score of 15. Digit Span Backward. Children were read from 2-8 numbers and asked to recite them backwards. Two numbers repeated 4 times, and the rest repeated twice. Max score of 16. Card-sort task. Children sorted cards that were blue/red with either bunnies/boats on them into boxes that had either pictures of boats and bunnies or were blue and red. Time to sort and a correctness score were measured. Shape Trail Test. In trial A the children were to connect the dots in order from 1-15. In trial B the children were to connect the dots (1-8 circles and 1-7 squares) in order, alternating between circles and squares. Time to completion was measured. From the authors: \"In this paper we report an initial validation of the Shape Trail Test–Child Version (STT-CV) with a non-clinical sample of children aged 6 to 9 years. The STT-CV has been developed as an age-appropriate and culturally fair direct downward extension of the Trail Making Test (TMT) for the assessment of cognitive flexibility.\"",

To test this, we focus on a ubiquitous real-life source of conditional behaviour: the expected relational value of social partners, both in terms of their quality and the likely quantity of future interactions with them.\"",

      "details": "The control group `condition == 0` did not see any dogs doing anything. When `condition == 1`, the dog saw **the same dog** go around the wall in the \"wrong\" direction three times. When `condition == 3`, the dog saw **three different dogs** go around the wall in the \"wrong\" direction one time. In the experimental setup, each dog repeated the experiment three times. Dogs were led to the spot where they would have to decide which way to go around the wall according to `start_direction`. If `start_direction == 1`, then the dog was led to the spot in such a way that the dog was already facing the direction it had been trained to go. When `start_direction == 0`, the dog was led to the spot facing the direction it was not trained to go. Some dogs did not complete the trial because of stress or some other reason, They are indicated by `dropout == 1`. From the authors: \"In recent years, an increasing number of studies has investigated majority influence in nonhuman animals. However, due to both terminological and methodological issues, evidence for conformity in nonhuman animals is scarce and controversial. Preliminary evidence suggests that wild birds, wild monkeys, and fish show conformity, that is, forgoing personal information in order to copy the majority. By contrast, chimpanzees seem to lack this tendency. The present study is the first to examine whether dogs (Canis familiaris) show conformity.\"",

However, there is minimal data on influenza virus aerosol shedding, the infectiousness of exhaled aerosols, and none on the impact of facemasks on viral aerosol shedding from patients with seasonal influenza.\"",

For this reason, there is a tremendous medical interest in harnessing the beneficial effects of THC. Behavioral studies carried out in mice lacking 5-HT2A receptors (5-HT2AR) revealed a remarkable 5-HT2AR-dependent dissociation in the beneficial antinociceptive effects of THC and its detrimental amnesic properties.\"",

In this study, we investigate another subtler, yet powerful factor that contributes to this fear: the ominous background music that often accompanies shark footage in documentaries.\" The music in this experiment comes from https://open.spotify.com/album/7AQ9M23tA6AlBSsl7DocBJ.
