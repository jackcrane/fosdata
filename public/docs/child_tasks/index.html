<meta name="description" content="Child_tasks# Time that it takes children to complete various activities.
More information on the activities of the children. The day-night test. Children are told to say “day” when shown a picture of the moon and stars, and to say “night” when shown a picture of the sun. Time to complete test and number correct (0 incorrect, 1 point for self-corrected, 2 points for correct) are measured. Counting-span test. Children were required to count the number of red dots on cards, and recall the number of dots without looking at them. Given in sets of 1 through 5. Max score of 15. Digit Span Backward. Children were read from 2-8 numbers and asked to recite them backwards. Two numbers repeated 4 times, and the rest repeated twice. Max score of 16. Card-sort task. Children sorted cards that were blue/red with either bunnies/boats on them into boxes that had either pictures of boats and bunnies or were blue and red. Time to sort and a correctness score were measured. Shape Trail Test. In trial A the children were to connect the dots in order from 1-15. In trial B the children were to connect the dots (1-8 circles and 1-7 squares) in order, alternating between circles and squares. Time to completion was measured. From the authors: “In this paper we report an initial validation of the Shape Trail Test–Child Version (STT-CV) with a non-clinical sample of children aged 6 to 9 years. The STT-CV has been developed as an age-appropriate and culturally fair direct downward extension of the Trail Making Test (TMT) for the assessment of cognitive flexibility.”

<p>Time that it takes children to complete various activities.</p>
<p>More information on the activities of the children. The day-night test. Children are told to say &ldquo;day&rdquo; when shown a picture of the moon and stars, and to say &ldquo;night&rdquo; when shown a picture of the sun. Time to complete test and number correct (0 incorrect, 1 point for self-corrected, 2 points for correct) are measured. Counting-span test. Children were required to count the number of red dots on cards, and recall the number of dots without looking at them. Given in sets of 1 through 5. Max score of 15. Digit Span Backward. Children were read from 2-8 numbers and asked to recite them backwards. Two numbers repeated 4 times, and the rest repeated twice. Max score of 16. Card-sort task. Children sorted cards that were blue/red with either bunnies/boats on them into boxes that had either pictures of boats and bunnies or were blue and red. Time to sort and a correctness score were measured. Shape Trail Test. In trial A the children were to connect the dots in order from 1-15. In trial B the children were to connect the dots (1-8 circles and 1-7 squares) in order, alternating between circles and squares. Time to completion was measured. From the authors: &ldquo;In this paper we report an initial validation of the Shape Trail Test–Child Version (STT-CV) with a non-clinical sample of children aged 6 to 9 years. The STT-CV has been developed as an age-appropriate and culturally fair direct downward extension of the Trail Making Test (TMT) for the assessment of cognitive flexibility.&rdquo;</p>
