This study tries to determine whether dogs follow their training over the example of other dogs. Dogs were trained to walk around a wall a certain direction, and then they observed other walking around the wall in the opposite direction. Which way does the dog choose?\nThe control group condition == 0 did not see any dogs doing anything. When condition == 1, the dog saw the same dog go around the wall in the \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; direction three times. When condition == 3, the dog saw three different dogs go around the wall in the \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; direction one time. In the experimental setup, each dog repeated the experiment three times. Dogs were led to the spot where they would have to decide which way to go around the wall according to start_direction. If start_direction == 1, then the dog was led to the spot in such a way that the dog was already facing the direction it had been trained to go. When start_direction == 0, the dog was led to the spot facing the direction it was not trained to go. Some dogs did not complete the trial because of stress or some other reason, They are indicated by dropout == 1. From the authors: \u0026ldquo;In recent years, an increasing number of studies has investigated majority influence in nonhuman animals. However, due to both terminological and methodological issues, evidence for conformity in nonhuman animals is scarce and controversial. Preliminary evidence suggests that wild birds, wild monkeys, and fish show conformity, that is, forgoing personal information in order to copy the majority. By contrast, chimpanzees seem to lack this tendency.

At present, there is a scarcity of studies that compare different cast immobilization methods. The objective of the study was therefore to compare volar-flexion and ulnar deviation cast to functional cast position in the treatment of dorsally displaced distal radius fracture among elderly patients.\u0026rdquo;\nInitialization# library(fosdata) data \u0026lt;- fosdata::wristAccessing fields# data \u0026lt;- fosdata::wrist angulation_pre \u0026lt;- data$angulation_preLLM instructions# If using an LLM, you can copy-paste the following instructions to accompany your prompt to inform the model of the fields and their types in the dataset.\nLLM Instructions The fosdata::wrist dataset containing the following fields: fields[47]{name,type,values}: id,character,n/a age,numeric,n/a sex,numeric,n/a handed_side,numeric,n/a centre,numeric,n/a fracture_side,numeric,n/a cast_position,numeric,n/a pcs_start,numeric,n/a operativetreatment,numeric,n/a pain03m,numeric,n/a stiffness03m,numeric,n/a grip_strength_fractured_site,numeric,n/a grip_strength_controlled_site,numeric,n/a grip_strength_proportion,numeric,n/a times_outside_from_home,numeric,n/a distance_per_week,numeric,n/a ancillary_inside,numeric,n/a ancillary_outside,numeric,n/a guided_physiotherapy,numeric,n/a guided_physiotherapy_times,numeric,n/a cast_changes,numeric,n/a x15d3m,numeric,n/a x15d12m,numeric,n/a uv_3m,numeric,n/a inclination_3m,numeric,n/a angulation_3m,numeric,n/a uv_cast,numeric,n/a inclination_cast,numeric,n/a angluation_cast,numeric,n/a wrist_flexion_in_cast,numeric,n/a x3mcpra_dulnardeviationdg,numeric,n/a uv_pre,numeric,n/a inclination_pre,numeric,n/a angulation_pre,numeric,n/a articulariness,numeric,n/a psu_fracture,numeric,n/a qd3m,numeric,n/a qd12m,numeric,n/a vas3m,numeric,n/a vas12m,numeric,n/a pcs3m,numeric,n/a pcs12m,numeric,n/a cast_change_category,numeric,n/a prwe12m,numeric,n/a prwe3m,numeric,n/a d_pcs1,numeric,n/a d_pcs2,numeric,n/a \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e webR + fosdata Test webR + fosdata test Execute R Code Output Plot Fields# Name Description Type Min Max Values id ID number character - - - age Age in years numeric 65 94 - sex 0 = man and 1 = female numeric - 1 - handed_side 1 = right and 2 = left numeric 1 2 - centre Centres are anonymised in this excel file numeric 1 3 - fracture_side 1 = right and 2 = left numeric 1 2 - cast_position 1 = functional cast position and 2 = volar-flexion and ulnar deviation cast position numeric 1 2 - pcs_start PCS score at baseline of follow-up numeric - 47 - operativetreatment No-operative treatment during follow-up = 0 and operative treatment during follow-up numeric - 1 - pain03m Reported pain of the fractured wrist at the outpatient visit at 3 months: 0 = no and 1 = yes numeric - 1 - stiffness03m Reported stiffness of the fractured wrist at the outpatient visit at 3 months: 0 = no and 1 = yes numeric - 1 - grip_strength_fractured_site undefined numeric 2 32 - grip_strength_controlled_site undefined numeric 6 54 - grip_strength_proportion Grip strength of fractured side to controlled side, proportion numeric 0.0667 1 - times_outside_from_home How many times the patient leave from home per week in average numeric - 14 - distance_per_week How many kilometers does the patient walk when leaving from home in average numeric - 17.5 - ancillary_inside Does the patient use walking aids inside of home: 0 = no and 1 = yes numeric - 1 - ancillary_outside Does the patient use walking aids outside of home: 0 = no and 1 = yes numeric - 1 - guided_physiotherapy Did the patient use guided physiotherapy for fractured hand during follow-up: 0 = no and 1 = yes numeric - 1 - guided_physiotherapy_times How many physiotherapist visits patient underwent if guided physiotherapy was used? numeric - 15 - cast_changes How many cast changes patient underwent, if any? numeric - 3 - x15d3m Health-related quality of life measured with 15D at 3 months of follow-up numeric 0.4428 1 - x15d12m Health-related quality of life measured with 15D at 12 months of follow-up numeric 0.5441 1 - uv_3m Ulnar variance at 3 months in millimeters: + = ulnar bone is more lengthy than radial bone numeric -2.2 12.1 - inclination_3m undefined numeric 7 25 - angulation_3m undefined numeric -10 35 - uv_cast Ulnar variance after closed reduction in millimeters: + = ulnar bone is more lengthy than radial bone numeric -3.6 9 - inclination_cast Inclination after closed reduction numeric 9 26 - angluation_cast Angulation after closed reduction: + dorsal angulation and - volar angulation numeric -10 32 - wrist_flexion_in_cast Angulation between 2nd metacarpal and radial bone after closed reduction and casting: + = dorsal flexion and - = volar flexion.
